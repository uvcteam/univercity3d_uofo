                    <strong>In simple terms: </strong>

                    <strong>In simple terms: </strong>
                    There is always some jerk out there that doesn’t care about who it harms and just wants to hack into stuff for the fun of it. We can’t guarantee that they
                    won’t be successful, but with your help we can make it hard on them.

                    <strong>In simple terms: </strong>

                    <strong>6. Indemnity</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>a.</strong>
                    <strong>Union Hall </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through Union Hall, UniverCity provides tools that enable our users to arrange physical meetings (“Social Engagements”) at venues that include, but are not
                    limited to, public parks, recreational areas, campus facilities, private homes and private enterprises (such as coffee shops or retail stores). We do not
                    supervise these Social Engagements and are not involved in any way with the actions of any individuals at these Social Engagements. As a result, we have no
                    control over the identity or actions of the individuals who are present at these Social Engagements, and we request that our users exercise caution and
                    good judgment when attending Social Engagements. Because we do not supervise or control the Social Engagements or interactions among or between members or
                    others at these events, and because we are not involved in any way with physical transportation to or from Social Engagements or with the actions of any
                    individuals attending such events, and because we have very limited control, if any, over the quality, safety, morality, legality, truthfulness or accuracy
                    of various aspects of any Social Engagement offered through Union Hall; you agree that you bear all risk and you agree to release us (and our officers,
                    directors, shareholders, agents, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, and third party partners) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and
                    unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, now and in the future, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Platform, your Third Party
                    Transactions, our resolution of any disputes among users, and/or your transportation to or from, attendance at, or the actions of you or other persons at,
                    a Social Engagement. You further waive any and all rights and benefits otherwise conferred by any statutory or non-statutory law of any jurisdiction that
                    would purport to limit the scope of a release or waiver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>In simple terms:</strong>
                    Through Union Hall we provide a platform to plan, schedule and RSVP to attend Social Engagements. However, we are not running these events, nor are we
                    chaperoning them. Therefore what happens at these events is beyond our control and you agree to not sue us if something untoward happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>b. Virtual Mall</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the Virtual Mall, UniverCity provides a platform for businesses to advertise their products and services and to offer various types of discounts
                    and promotions. We are not in any way involved in the substance of these ads, discounts, or promotions, nor are we in anyway involved in the transactions
                    themselves. If you purchase products or services from any of these businesses, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless UniverCity and its officers,
                    directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses,
                    including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees (including costs of defense of claims, suits or proceedings brought by third parties),
                    in any way related to your purchase(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>In simple term: </strong>
                    If you buy goods or services for any of the businesses that advertise through UniverCity, your purchase is between you and that company. We are not
                    involved and you agree not to sue us if you have a dispute with that business. On the other hand, we only want reputable businesses advertising through
                    UniverCity, so we want to know if a business is not operating in good faith.
                </p>

                    <strong>7. Disclaimers</strong>

                    UniverCity takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other user or third party posts or transmits using our

                    <strong>In simple terms: </strong>
                    Unfortunately, people post bad stuff on sites like UniverCity. We take that kind of thing seriously but you still might run into it before we have a chance
                    to take it down. If you see bad stuff, please report it to us.<strong></strong>
                </p>

                    <strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNIVERCITY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY
                    LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A)
                    YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT
                    LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR
                    TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL UNIVERCITY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S.
                    $100.00).

                    <strong>In simple terms: </strong>
                    We are building the best service we can for you but we can't promise it will be perfect. We're not liable for various things. If you think we are, let's
                    try to work it out like adults.<strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>9. Arbitration</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any dispute you have with UniverCity, you agree to first <a href="https://support.pinterest.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact us</a>
                    and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If UniverCity has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve
                    any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these
                    Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for
                    Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and UniverCity agree otherwise, the arbitration will be
                    conducted in the county where the college or university you attend is located. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and
                    arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that UniverCity will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim
                    for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award
                    rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any
                    judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party
                    from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the
                    Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                    PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS,
                    YOU AND UNIVERCITY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

                <p>
                    These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the
                    personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Multnomah County, Oregon or the United States District Court for Oregon, for any actions not subject to
                    Section 9 (Arbitration).

                    Portland is a great place to visit and we love it. So, if you have to sue us, you’ll have to sue us here.

                    UniverCity reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if
                    we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole
                    discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or use the Products after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the
                    revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Products.

                    <em>Assignment.</em>
                    These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by UniverCity without
                    restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

                    <em>Entire Agreement/Severability.</em>
                    These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with UniverCity in connection with the
                    Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and UniverCity concerning the Products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then
                    that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
                    effect.

                <p>
                    <em>No Waiver.</em>
                    No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and UniverCity's failure to assert any
                    right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
